# Laugh Lab Pro - Stage 11: Real-Time Collaborative Editing

## Summary

Enables multiple users to edit the script simultaneously in real time, turning the single-writer analysis tool into a collaborative writing environment. This stage implements a Google Docs-style editor for comedy writing, where every participant’s changes are synced live. Under the hood, it maintains a single master script document and broadcasts edits to all collaborators, ensuring everyone sees the latest version instantly. This allows a writers’ room to jointly refine a script using Laugh Lab’s tools together.

## Trigger / Function

Activated on-demand when a user initiates a collaboration session (e.g. by inviting others to their script or switching to “Team Edit” mode). Not a sequential analysis step, but rather an orchestration feature triggered by a UI action. The relevant function could be an initialization routine (e.g. startCollaborationSession(scriptId)) that sets up WebSocket connections for that script. Once active, each keystroke or edit operation by any user is captured (in the browser) and sent to the server via a WebSocket channel. A collaboration service (or module within the backend, e.g. CollabManager) receives these edit events and applies them to the master script text, then relays the changes to all other clients in the session.

## Data Contract

Input: A continuous stream of edit events (e.g. insertions, deletions, cursor moves) with user identifiers. Each event might be a small JSON message like {user: "Alice", action: "insert", position: 123, text: "haha"}. The collaboration service processes these against the current script state. Output: The canonical script content updated in real-time, and broadcast events to other collaborators (e.g. “Bob inserted a line at page 4”). For persistence, the system also periodically saves the current script version to the database. Additionally, presence data (who is currently online and where their cursor is) is part of the output to clients. This stage doesn’t produce a final report artifact, but it ensures the script data remains consistent across users.

## UI Display

The primary interface is the script editor itself, now enhanced with real-time features. Users see changes from others appear instantly in the text. Indicators in the UI show collaborator cursors or selections in distinct colors (e.g. “Alice is typing…” labels near the line being edited). A status icon might indicate live collaboration mode (possibly a “connected” symbol). There may also be a sidebar list of active collaborators. The UI must handle conflict resolution gracefully – e.g. if two users edit the exact same line at once, the last edit wins or the system merges changes; minor alerts might show “Conflict resolved” if it happens. Overall, Stage 11’s UI transforms the static editor into a multi-user editor with minimal latency, emulating a virtual writer’s room.

## QA / Validation Steps

Testing real-time editing requires multiple clients. Simulate two or more users editing the same script: ensure that typing on one client immediately reflects on the others at the correct location. Introduce deliberate conflicts (e.g. both users edit the same word simultaneously) and verify the resolution strategy: one edit should win and the other’s cursor should reposition appropriately, or a merge prompt should appear if implemented. Check that no changes are lost – all edits should be preserved in the master document (review saved document after a flurry of concurrent edits). Also test network resilience: if one user’s connection drops and reconnects, the editor should sync up with the latest document without duplicating or missing text. Security test: ensure that only invited collaborators can connect (e.g. a user not in the session shouldn’t receive the edits). Finally, ensure that switching to collaboration mode doesn’t break the analysis pipeline – e.g. the user can still run analysis (possibly the analysis runs on the master document and results are shared with all).

## Optional (Dev Notes)

This stage relies on WebSockets – developers should confirm the back-end (likely Node.js) properly handles multiple WebSocket connections and broadcasts. Key endpoints: a WebSocket endpoint like wss://api.laughlab.com/collab (or a specific script channel). Logging each edit event (in dev mode) can help debug synchronization issues. There might be a versioning mechanism (like Operational Transforms or CRDTs) under the hood; if using a library, ensure it’s configured properly. DevOps should monitor for performance issues with many concurrent editors (simulate e.g. 5-10 users typing at once). Memory usage of storing revisions or undo history on the server should also be checked.
