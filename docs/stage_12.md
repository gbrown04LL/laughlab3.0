# Laugh Lab Pro - Stage 12: Writer‚Äôs Room Chat

## Summary

Provides a live chat channel for collaborators to discuss ideas and communicate outside of the script text. This feature adds a sidebar chat, essentially a real-time messaging tool integrated with the writing session. It‚Äôs like a virtual writer‚Äôs room conversation, allowing the team to brainstorm out-of-script before deciding what to include. The chat keeps all collaborators on the same page (literally and figuratively) and can be persisted for record-keeping.

## Trigger / Function

Enabled automatically when a collaborative session starts (or when a user opens the chat panel). The backend runs a chat service (could be using the same WebSocket connection or a parallel one) to handle messages. For example, a function postChatMessage(sessionId, user, message) is called when someone sends a message, broadcasting it to all in the session. The chat history might be stored temporarily in memory and periodically saved to a database for that session. There may be an API endpoint for fetching recent messages when a new user joins (e.g. GET /session/:id/chatHistory).

## Data Contract

Input: Chat message events containing the sender, timestamp, and message text. Output: Broadcast of messages to all participants. The persistent data is the chat log, which could be stored as a list of messages (each with user, time, text). The chat doesn‚Äôt directly feed into the comedy analysis, so it remains separate from the main analysis JSON ‚Äì instead, it‚Äôs part of the collaboration session data. Possibly, certain special messages (commands) could be interpreted (e.g. ‚Äú/idea‚Äù to create a brainstorm card, see Stage 13), but generally it‚Äôs free-form text passed along.

## UI Display

A chat sidebar is shown alongside the script editor during collaboration. It displays messages in chronological order, labeled with the sender‚Äôs name (or avatar) and time. The UI likely uses speech-bubble or threaded styling to distinguish different users‚Äô messages. It might also support simple markdown or emoji, to keep the brainstorming fun (e.g. üëç reactions to pitches). A text input box at the bottom allows users to type new messages. If the chat can switch to different modes (as Stage 13 describes a brainstorm board mode), there would be UI controls (tabs or toggle) to switch between Chat and Brainstorm Board view. When in chat mode, all new messages appear in real-time without needing refresh. The design ensures the chat panel is unobtrusive yet easily accessible, complementing the script editor (for instance, resizing or hide/show the chat).

## QA / Validation Steps

Perform multi-user testing: have two or more collaborators send messages and confirm all parties see them with correct user attribution. Test ordering ‚Äì messages should appear in the same order they were sent (even if two are sent nearly simultaneously, check the timestamp ordering or an ID to sort). Validate that the chat can handle rapid message flow (typing a quick series of messages doesn‚Äôt lag or drop any). New participants joining mid-session should load the past messages: test that scenario to ensure the history fetch works and that it doesn‚Äôt duplicate messages already shown. Also verify special content: send a long message to see that text wrapping and scrolling work in the UI; send potentially problematic content (e.g. HTML or scripts) to ensure it‚Äôs escaped or sanitized for security. Since this is a communication tool, also consider privacy and retention: perhaps verify that when a collaboration session ends, the chat log is saved or cleared appropriately.

## Optional

The chat might be extended with slash-commands or integrated bot suggestions (for example, an AI persona might post a tip in chat occasionally as described in the project outline). If so, test those automations (e.g. /askAI generating a message from the AI assistant). From a dev perspective, the chat uses WebSocket events (or could use a service like Socket.io). Monitoring the socket connection is key ‚Äì perhaps implement a heartbeat or ping to ensure the connection stays alive. In DevTools, one can inspect the WebSocket frames to confirm message payloads. If using the same socket for editing and chat, ensure message types are clearly distinguished to route them correctly on the client.
