## Implementation Overview

This document provides **Lovable-ready specifications** for Stages 6 through 14 of the Laugh Lab Pro comedy analysis pipeline. Each stage follows a consistent PR-style format with:

- **Summary**: High-level description of the stage's purpose
- **Trigger Details**: How and when the stage is invoked
- **Data Contract**: Input/output specifications and API contracts
- **UI Display**: Frontend presentation and user experience
- **QA Steps**: Validation and testing procedures
- **Dev Notes**: Implementation guidance and technical considerations

These stages build upon the foundation established in Stages 1-5 and extend the platform with advanced analysis features (Stages 6-10) and collaborative capabilities (Stages 11-14).

## Stage 6: Targeted Gap Punch-Ups

### Summary

Generates specific punch-up suggestions for the largest humor gaps identified in the script. For each significant comedic gap (especially the "retention cliff" and other top gaps from Stage 5), the system produces 2–4 tailored joke ideas or enhancements to insert, helping the writer fill those lulls with laughter. These suggestions aim to be context-aware (e.g. callbacks, character-specific humor) so they seamlessly elevate the scene's comedy.

### Trigger / Function

Invoked by the analysis flow after Stage 5 (Gap Diagnosis) completes, typically via the orchestration pipeline (e.g. `runStage(6)` within `analyzeScript`). The backend function (e.g. `generatePunchUpSuggestions`) takes the gap analysis data and script context as input. It likely calls an LLM to create punch-up lines for each major gap, using the surrounding dialogue as context.

### Data Contract

**Input:** A list of identified comedy gaps from Stage 5 (with their line ranges, context snippets, and priority).

**Output:** A structured set of punch-up suggestions for each gap. Each suggestion may include:
- Gap identifier
- Proposed new joke line(s)
- Metadata (e.g. humor type or complexity level if applicable)

The suggestions are stored in the analysis results JSON under a `gapPunchups` section, keyed by gap, so the frontend can display them under the corresponding gap.

**Example JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "gapPunchups": {
    "gap_A": [
      {
        "id": "punch_1",
        "line": "Maybe the real treasure was the friends we disappointed along the way.",
        "humorType": "callback",
        "complexity": "Advanced"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### UI Display

Rendered in the **"Targeted Gap Punch-Ups"** panel of the Results view. For each gap (often labeled Gap A, B, C or by scene/line range), the UI lists the punch-up ideas as bullet points or numbered suggestions. They may be presented as expandable examples under each gap description.

**Design Requirements:**
- Follow existing styling for suggestions cards
- Ensure each suggested joke is clearly distinguishable
- Use icons or highlighting for Advanced vs. High-complexity jokes
- Panel typically shown after the Gap Diagnosis graph
- Collapsed by default to avoid overwhelming the user
- Display prompt like "💡 3 Punch-Up Ideas Available"

### QA / Validation Steps

1. **Basic Functionality:** Use a script with a known long humor gap. After analysis, confirm that the output JSON includes punch-up suggestions for that gap and that they appear in the UI under the correct gap label.

2. **Contextual Relevance:** Test that suggestions are contextually relevant (e.g. refer to characters or situations in the gap's vicinity).

3. **Edge Cases:** Verify that if no significant gaps are found, the stage returns an empty suggestions list or a friendly message ("No major gaps – no punch-ups needed!") and the UI panel handles that gracefully (e.g. hidden or showing a "no suggestions" note).

4. **AI Quality:** Because this stage uses AI generation, review suggestions for appropriateness and comedic value.

### Dev Notes (Optional)

- This stage's implementation may reuse the same LLM integration as the main feedback, but with a prompt specialized for punch-ups
- The function might be throttled or stubbed in dev mode
- **Relevant endpoint:** None if using single analysis API (the suggestions are part of the main JSON), otherwise an endpoint like `/analysis/:id/punchups` could trigger it
- Developers can use DevTools to inspect the network response ensuring the `gapPunchups` data is present

## Stage 7: Joke Quality Check & Classification

### Summary

Evaluates each identified joke in the script for its quality and type, classifying jokes into tiers (e.g. Basic, Standard, Intermediate, Advanced, High-Complexity) and flagging those that are low-impact or could be improved. It acts as a "joke QA" stage – ensuring the comedy is not only frequent but also high-quality. The stage may suggest improvements for weaker jokes (e.g. "This punchline is fairly basic; consider adding a twist").

### Trigger / Function

Executed after initial metrics and punch-ups, via the pipeline (e.g. `runStage(7)`). The function (possibly `analyzeJokeQuality` or part of `analyzeScript`) uses the list of jokes detected in earlier stages. It might re-use the classification from Stage 1's detection (which already tags joke complexity) and/or call an AI to double-check humor effectiveness. Essentially, it cross-verifies each joke's score and category. If any joke falls below a certain quality threshold (e.g. marked "Basic"), the system can flag it for punch-up.

### Data Contract

**Input:** A list of all jokes or punchlines identified (with their text, line number, and initial complexity rating from earlier analysis).

**Output:** An enriched list of jokes with a "quality" classification and optional comments. For each joke, the output might include:
- `classificationTier` (Basic/Standard/Intermediate/Advanced/High)
- `flaggedForImprovement` (boolean) if low-tier
- `improvementSuggestion` (text, optional)

This data is appended to the analysis JSON under a `jokeQuality` or similar node, and may also update overall metrics (e.g. count of jokes by tier).

**Example JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "jokeQuality": {
    "jokes": [
      {
        "id": "joke_1",
        "text": "That's what she said",
        "lineNumber": 42,
        "classificationTier": "Basic",
        "flaggedForImprovement": true,
        "improvementSuggestion": "Try a misdirection here to elevate this joke"
      }
    ],
    "distribution": {
      "Basic": 2,
      "Standard": 5,
      "Intermediate": 5,
      "Advanced": 3,
      "High": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### UI Display

Shown in the **"Joke Quality & Classification"** panel in the results UI. This panel could list jokes or summarize quality distribution.

**Design Options:**

**Option 1 - Detailed List:**
- Show each joke (or a snippet of it) with a badge indicating its classification
- Use color-coded tags for Basic, Advanced, etc.
- Display icon or warning for those flagged as weak
- Hovering or expanding a flagged joke reveals the suggested improvement

**Option 2 - Aggregate Summary:**
- Display: "Jokes by Quality: 2 Basic, 5 Intermediate, 3 Advanced, 1 High – some basic jokes detected; consider refining them."
- Include a visual breakdown (bar chart or pie chart)

The naming and design mirror existing components (likely an extension of the joke detection panel).

### QA / Validation Steps

1. **Classification Accuracy:** Test with scripts containing a mix of joke types (e.g. one script with very obvious simple jokes, another with complex layered jokes). Verify that Stage 7 correctly classifies each (matching known categories).

2. **Count Verification:** Check that the counts of each tier match expectations and that any suggestions to improve are sensible (not appearing for already high-tier jokes).

3. **False Positive/Negative Handling:** If a joke is misidentified, ensure the system's fallback doesn't flag it too aggressively (to avoid noise).

4. **Integration Testing:** From a developer standpoint, ensure that adding this stage's data doesn't break the JSON contract for earlier stages.

5. **Tier-Based Display:** Toggling this stage off (for lower-tier users) should hide the panel entirely.

### Dev Notes (Optional)

- **Endpoints/DevTools:** In a single-API architecture, this stage's logic is internal. If separately accessible, an endpoint like `/analysis/:id/jokes` might return the joke list with classifications
- Use the browser console to inspect the `jokeQuality` data structure in the global state after analysis
- Consider adding unit tests for the classification logic (feeding known jokes lines to ensure they map to expected tiers)
- Prompt tuning for the AI (if used) can be validated by checking a sample of AI outputs for edge cases (e.g. sarcasm detection)

## Stage 8: Character & Relationship Analytics

### Summary

Analyzes the script's humor distribution across characters and the comedic dynamics between them. It identifies which characters are driving the comedy (e.g. jokes per character) and whether the humor is balanced or one-note. Additionally, it examines relationships or interactions – for instance, detecting comedic pairings or how characters' interactions contribute to laughs. The goal is to ensure an ensemble comedy has diverse contributions and to flag if any character is underutilized humor-wise.

### Trigger / Function

Runs in the professional-tier analysis flow (triggered via `runStage(8)`) after the core script analysis. The implementation (e.g. `analyzeCharacters`) uses data extracted during parsing: notably the mapping of dialogue lines to characters and the jokes identified. It likely tallies metrics per character (lines spoken, jokes delivered, laughter score contribution) and might use an AI module to qualitatively assess character humor (e.g. identifying each character's comedic voice or role). If relationship dynamics are analyzed, the function might look at dialogue exchanges to see if certain character pairs or groups generate humor together (e.g. a straight-man/funny-man duo pattern).

### Data Contract

**Input:** Structured script content annotated with speaker tags for each line, plus joke indicators from earlier stages.

**Output:** Character-level comedy stats and insights. For each major character, data could include:
- `totalLines` - number of lines spoken
- `totalJokes` - number of jokes delivered
- `jokePercentage` - percentage of their lines that are jokes
- `humorScoreContribution` - contribution to overall humor score
- Character ranking by number of jokes

For relationship analysis, the output could list:
- Top character pairs (e.g. "Alice & Bob have 5 banter moments")
- Notes on whether any character is frequently the butt of jokes vs. the joker

This data is stored under a `characterAnalysis` node in the JSON.

**Example JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "characterAnalysis": {
    "characters": [
      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "totalLines": 45,
        "totalJokes": 18,
        "jokePercentage": 40.0,
        "humorScoreContribution": 35.2,
        "role": "primary_comic"
      }
    ],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "pair": ["Alice", "Bob"],
        "banterMoments": 5,
        "dynamic": "straight_man_funny_man"
      }
    ],
    "insights": "Character A carries most of the comedic weight with 40% of all jokes, while Character C has few comedic lines – consider giving them more funny moments."
  }
}
```

### UI Display

Presented in the **"Character & Relationship Analytics"** panel. Likely this appears as a dedicated section of the results dashboard for pro/expert users.

**Design Requirements:**

**Character Contribution View:**
- Bar chart or list showing each character's contribution to humor
- Visual representation of how many laughs each character delivers
- Textual summary accompanies the chart

**Relationship View:**
- Bullet points or cards showing character dynamics
- Example: "Alice and Bob form a strong comedic duo, appearing together in 30% of jokes. Meanwhile, Carol often sets up jokes that Dave delivers – a classic straight vs. comic dynamic."

**Layout:**
- Panel matches the project's card style
- Possibly with sub-tabs or toggle between "By Character" and "By Relationship"

### QA / Validation Steps

1. **Accuracy Testing:** Use a sample script with multiple characters (e.g. a sitcom scene) where you know how jokes are divided. Verify the character stats match (if Character X has 3 jokes, ensure the output reflects that).

2. **Zero-Joke Characters:** Check that a character with zero jokes is handled properly (the UI might list them with 0 or omit them with a note).

3. **Relationship Detection:** If possible, create a scenario where two characters frequently joke together and see if the system notes that pairing.

4. **Minor Characters:** Ensure minor characters (with very few lines) don't skew the analysis or UI (they might be grouped as "Others" if needed).

5. **Data Integration:** Confirm the data joins correctly with the script (character names exactly matching those in the script to aggregate counts).

6. **Edge Case - Monologue:** Monologue or stand-up style scripts (only one "character") – the panel should gracefully handle a single-character scenario (likely simplifying to "all jokes by this character").

### Dev Notes (Optional)

- The implementation might rely on accurate dialogue tagging from preprocessing. If using a screenplay format, ensure the parser reliably captures character names
- An endpoint like `/analysis/:id/characters` could fetch this data for external use (if provided)
- For developers, using sample JSON from this stage in DevTools ensures the front-end renders it correctly – e.g. check the array of characters and their joke counts in the console
- If relationship analysis is more complex (like detecting comedic foils), that may be a stretch goal; the spec can note it as a future enhancement if not fully implemented initially

## Stage 9: Callback Architecture Mapping

### Summary

Maps out the callbacks (running gags or repeated jokes) within the script and highlights opportunities for additional callbacks. A callback is a comedic reference to a setup made earlier. This stage identifies where callbacks occur (which joke refers back to an earlier one) and assesses the effectiveness and frequency of these callbacks. It also flags missed opportunities – places where a prior joke or theme could be echoed for extra laughs but wasn't. The result is a "callback map" of the script's humor architecture.

### Trigger / Function

Launched in the analysis sequence for professional tier (via `runStage(9)`). The underlying function (e.g. `analyzeCallbacks`) scans the script's joke list and narrative for repeated motifs. This may involve text analysis (searching for repeated unique phrases/names associated with jokes) and possibly semantic analysis with AI to catch non-verbatim callbacks (e.g. a situation in Act 3 that mirrors a joke from Act 1). The function uses the data from Stage 1 (where each joke could carry an ID or content snippet) to link jokes that are related. It likely also computes a **Callback Frequency** metric (percentage of jokes that are callbacks). If the frequency is low or zero, it suggests adding callbacks.

### Data Contract

**Input:** Full script text or tokenized form, with marked jokes from earlier stages. Possibly also the list of significant story elements or comedic themes (if provided by an AI pass).

**Output:** A structured representation of callbacks. For example:
- An array of callback clusters, where each cluster has:
  - Description of the original joke (the "setup")
  - References to all later jokes that callback to it (with their line numbers or IDs)
  - Each callback instance might include its line and a brief identification of how it relates (e.g. same punchline phrase, same situational gag)

Additionally, the output might include:
- Summary metrics like `callbackCount` and `callbackFrequencyPercent`
- Missed opportunity suggestions (list of promising setups that had no callback, with notes)

The output is added to the JSON under `callbackAnalysis` or similar.

**Example JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "callbackAnalysis": {
    "callbacks": [
      {
        "id": "callback_1",
        "setup": {
          "line": "Alice's coffee spill",
          "lineNumber": 15,
          "page": 2
        },
        "references": [
          {
            "lineNumber": 45,
            "page": 5,
            "relation": "same_punchline_phrase"
          },
          {
            "lineNumber": 89,
            "page": 10,
            "relation": "situational_echo"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "metrics": {
      "callbackCount": 5,
      "callbackFrequencyPercent": 15.0
    },
    "missedOpportunities": [
      {
        "setup": "Bob's car joke",
        "lineNumber": 23,
        "page": 3,
        "suggestion": "Consider a callback in later scenes"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### UI Display

Shown in the **"Callback Mapping"** panel (or "Callback Architecture" panel). This could be a visual or textual map of the callbacks.

**Design Options:**

**Option 1 - List View:**
- List each identified callback chain
- Example: "**Running Gag: Alice's coffee spill** – introduced on page 2, later referenced on page 5 and page 10"
- Indent the references under the original or use arrows to show linkage

**Option 2 - Visual Timeline:**
- If a visual graph is feasible, callbacks could be plotted on a timeline of the script
- Markers connected by lines showing the callback relationship

**Metrics Display:**
- Display the Callback Frequency (e.g. "Callbacks comprise 15% of all jokes")

**Missed Opportunities:**
- Appear as italicized tips: "The joke about Bob's car (page 3) isn't referenced again – consider a callback in later scenes."

The design should align with the existing result panels, likely text-focused with icons for clarity (e.g. a link icon next to callback jokes).

### QA / Validation Steps

1. **Callback Detection:** Use a script with known callbacks (e.g. a running gag repeated 3 times). Verify the system identifies all instances and groups them correctly.

2. **Missed Opportunity Detection:** Test with a script that has an obvious setup with no payoff. Confirm the stage flags it as a missed opportunity.

3. **Frequency Calculation:** Verify the callback frequency percentage is calculated correctly (number of callback jokes / total jokes * 100).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Script with zero callbacks should show 0% frequency and possibly a note suggesting callbacks could enhance the script
   - Very subtle callbacks (semantic rather than verbatim) should ideally be caught if AI is used

5. **UI Navigation:** If using a visual timeline, test that it scales properly for different script lengths (short sketches vs. long screenplays).

6. **Performance:** For long scripts with many jokes, ensure the callback detection algorithm performs efficiently.

### Dev Notes (Optional)

- Relevant internals might include a text normalization function for jokes (to compare similarity) and perhaps a simple NLP component to detect paraphrased callbacks
- There could be a developer tool to visualize the callback graph for debugging
- If exposed, an API endpoint `/analysis/:id/callbacks` could return all callback groupings
- Logging could be added to see which lines were considered a callback to which (useful during development to refine the matching algorithm)

## Stage 10: Audience Simulation & Engagement

### Summary

Simulates an audience's reaction throughout the script to gauge engagement levels, predicting where laughs peak and where attention might wane. This stage produces an **engagement curve** – essentially a timeline of the script marked with laughter intensity or engagement scores. It uses the distribution of jokes (and their estimated strength) to infer how a typical audience might respond, highlighting sustained laughter sequences or dull stretches. The outcome helps writers see the emotional rhythm of their script (e.g. steady chuckles vs. big laughs vs. lulls).

### Trigger / Function

Initiated as the final analysis step for professional users (`runStage(10)` in the pipeline). The function (e.g. `simulateAudienceEngagement`) likely aggregates data from prior stages:
- Timing of jokes (from pacing analysis)
- Joke strength (from classification)
- Gap lengths

**Calculation Approach:**
- **Simple:** Treat each joke as a spike whose magnitude is the joke's complexity score (bigger joke → higher spike) and whose duration effect lasts a few seconds. Compute how close together spikes are (clusters of jokes = sustained engagement).
- **Advanced:** Incorporate an LLM to "read" the script and rate each scene for entertainment (could be slow; likely it's a rules-based simulation using quantitative metrics).

### Data Contract

**Input:** Comprehensive metrics from earlier stages – especially the timeline of jokes (with timestamps or line indices) and their weighted scores.

**Output:** An engagement profile dataset. For example:
- A time-series array where each entry corresponds to a position in the script (could be per minute or per scene) with an engagement level (0-10 or a percentage)
- Explicitly list "peak laugh moments" (highest predicted laughter points)
- Identify "low engagement segments" beyond a threshold

This data would be included under `audienceEngagement` in the JSON, potentially as:
- Array of `{position, score}` points
- Summary values (e.g. average engagement, peak score at X)
- Audience retention metric (chance of audience drop-off at certain points)

**Example JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "audienceEngagement": {
    "curve": [
      {"position": 0, "score": 7.5, "time": "0:00"},
      {"position": 1, "score": 8.2, "time": "1:30"},
      {"position": 2, "score": 5.1, "time": "3:00"}
    ],
    "peakMoments": [
      {
        "position": 30,
        "score": 9.8,
        "description": "Big laugh around page 30 when the wedding scene's punchline hits"
      }
    ],
    "lowEngagementSegments": [
      {
        "start": 15,
        "end": 20,
        "duration": "1 minute",
        "description": "Longest lull with no laughs in the middle of Act II"
      }
    ],
    "metrics": {
      "averageEngagement": 7.2,
      "peakEngagement": 9.8,
      "lowestEngagement": 3.5
    }
  }
}
```

### UI Display

Displayed in the **"Audience Engagement Simulation"** panel (possibly titled "Audience Reaction").

**Primary Visualization:**
- **Line graph (engagement curve)** across the script timeline
- X-axis: script progress (pages or time)
- Y-axis: predicted laughter/engagement level
- Peaks indicate big laughs; valleys indicate lulls

**Highlighted Elements:**
- Top 1-3 "Peak Laughter Moments" marked with stars on the graph
- Described: "Big laugh around page 30 when the wedding scene's punchline hits"
- Flag the longest low-engagement stretch (might overlap with retention cliff from Stage 5)

**Alternative - Timeline Bar:**
- Segments colored by engagement (green = high laughs, yellow = moderate, red = low/dull)

**Textual Summary:**
- Example: "Audience Engagement starts strong, dips slightly in the middle (around scene 5), then rises to a final big laugh at the end. The longest lull is ~1 minute with no laughs in the middle of Act II."

This gives writers a sense of pacing effectiveness.

### QA / Validation Steps

1. **Pattern Recognition:** Use well-understood scripts (e.g., one with evenly spaced jokes vs. one with all jokes in the first half). Confirm that the engagement curve reflects those patterns (flat vs. front-loaded).

2. **Peak Identification:** Cross-check the "peak moments" identified with known funny scenes in the script.

3. **Consistency with Stage 5:** Validate that the retention/dip identification aligns with Stage 5's gap (they should at least not contradict – e.g., a retention cliff should correspond to a low point on this curve).

4. **UI Scaling:** Test graphical output in the UI for different lengths of script (e.g. very short sketches vs. long screenplays) to ensure scaling is correct.

5. **Performance:** Test the performance of computing the engagement array for large scripts (optimizing loop or vector operations if needed).

6. **Edge Cases:** A drama script with zero jokes should result in a flat near-zero engagement line (and the panel might even suggest "This seems to have little comedy" if applicable).

### Dev Notes (Optional)

- If using a visualization library for the curve, ensure it's consistent with the rest of the results graphs (e.g. reuse the same chart component as the laugh distribution graph if possible)
- There may not be a separate API endpoint for this (as it's part of the main analysis), but developers can generate the engagement data by running the analysis in debug mode
- If the logic gets complex, unit tests simulating sequences of laughs (e.g. an array of joke times and weights) can verify the calculated engagement output
- Logging intermediate calculations (like total laughter per segment) might help debug any anomalies in the curve shape

## Stage 11: Real-Time Collaborative Editing

### Summary

Enables multiple users to edit the script simultaneously in real time, turning the single-writer analysis tool into a collaborative writing environment. This stage implements a **Google Docs-style editor** for comedy writing, where every participant's changes are synced live. Under the hood, it maintains a single master script document and broadcasts edits to all collaborators, ensuring everyone sees the latest version instantly. This allows a writers' room to jointly refine a script using Laugh Lab's tools together.

### Trigger / Function

Activated on-demand when a user initiates a collaboration session (e.g. by inviting others to their script or switching to "Team Edit" mode). Not a sequential analysis step, but rather an orchestration feature triggered by a UI action.

**Implementation:**
- Initialization routine (e.g. `startCollaborationSession(scriptId)`) sets up WebSocket connections for that script
- Once active, each keystroke or edit operation by any user is captured (in the browser) and sent to the server via a WebSocket channel
- A collaboration service (or module within the backend, e.g. `CollabManager`) receives these edit events and applies them to the master script text, then relays the changes to all other clients in the session

### Data Contract

**Input:** A continuous stream of edit events with user identifiers. Each event might be a small JSON message like:
```json
{
  "user": "Alice",
  "action": "insert",
  "position": 123,
  "text": "haha"
}
```

**Processing:** The collaboration service processes these against the current script state.

**Output:**
- The canonical script content updated in real-time
- Broadcast events to other collaborators (e.g. "Bob inserted a line at page 4")
- Periodically saves the current script version to the database
- Presence data (who is currently online and where their cursor is)

This stage doesn't produce a final report artifact, but it ensures the script data remains consistent across users.

**WebSocket Event Types:**
```typescript
type EditEvent = {
  type: 'insert' | 'delete' | 'replace';
  user: string;
  position: number;
  text?: string;
  length?: number;
  timestamp: number;
};

type PresenceEvent = {
  type: 'cursor' | 'selection';
  user: string;
  position: number;
  endPosition?: number;
};
```

### UI Display

The primary interface is the **script editor itself**, now enhanced with real-time features.

**Features:**
- Changes from others appear instantly in the text
- Indicators show collaborator cursors or selections in distinct colors
- "Alice is typing…" labels near the line being edited
- Status icon indicates live collaboration mode (possibly a "connected" symbol)
- Sidebar list of active collaborators

**Conflict Resolution:**
- If two users edit the exact same line at once, the last edit wins or the system merges changes
- Minor alerts might show "Conflict resolved" if it happens

Overall, Stage 11's UI transforms the static editor into a multi-user editor with minimal latency, emulating a virtual writer's room.

### QA / Validation Steps

1. **Multi-Client Testing:** Simulate two or more users editing the same script. Ensure that typing on one client immediately reflects on the others at the correct location.

2. **Conflict Resolution:** Introduce deliberate conflicts (e.g. both users edit the same word simultaneously). Verify the resolution strategy: one edit should win and the other's cursor should reposition appropriately, or a merge prompt should appear if implemented.

3. **Data Integrity:** Check that no changes are lost – all edits should be preserved in the master document (review saved document after a flurry of concurrent edits).

4. **Network Resilience:** If one user's connection drops and reconnects, the editor should sync up with the latest document without duplicating or missing text.

5. **Security:** Ensure that only invited collaborators can connect (e.g. a user not in the session shouldn't receive the edits).

6. **Analysis Integration:** Ensure that switching to collaboration mode doesn't break the analysis pipeline – e.g. the user can still run analysis (possibly the analysis runs on the master document and results are shared with all).

### Dev Notes (Optional)

- This stage relies on **WebSockets** – developers should confirm the back-end (likely Node.js) properly handles multiple WebSocket connections and broadcasts
- **Key endpoints:** A WebSocket endpoint like `wss://api.laughlab.com/collab` (or a specific script channel)
- Logging each edit event (in dev mode) can help debug synchronization issues
- There might be a versioning mechanism (like **Operational Transforms** or **CRDTs**) under the hood; if using a library, ensure it's configured properly
- DevOps should monitor for performance issues with many concurrent editors (simulate e.g. 5-10 users typing at once)
- Memory usage of storing revisions or undo history on the server should also be checked

## Stage 12: Writer's Room Chat

### Summary

Provides a **live chat channel** for collaborators to discuss ideas and communicate outside of the script text. This feature adds a sidebar chat, essentially a real-time messaging tool integrated with the writing session. It's like a virtual writer's room conversation, allowing the team to brainstorm out-of-script before deciding what to include. The chat keeps all collaborators on the same page (literally and figuratively) and can be persisted for record-keeping.

### Trigger / Function

Enabled automatically when a collaborative session starts (or when a user opens the chat panel). The backend runs a **chat service** (could be using the same WebSocket connection or a parallel one) to handle messages.

**Implementation:**
- Function `postChatMessage(sessionId, user, message)` is called when someone sends a message
- Broadcasts it to all in the session
- Chat history might be stored temporarily in memory and periodically saved to a database for that session
- API endpoint for fetching recent messages when a new user joins (e.g. `GET /session/:id/chatHistory`)

### Data Contract

**Input:** Chat message events containing:
- Sender
- Timestamp
- Message text

**Output:** Broadcast of messages to all participants.

**Persistent Data:** The chat log, stored as a list of messages (each with user, time, text).

The chat doesn't directly feed into the comedy analysis, so it remains separate from the main analysis JSON – instead, it's part of the collaboration session data.

**Message Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "msg_123",
  "sessionId": "session_456",
  "user": "Alice",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T14:30:00Z",
  "text": "What if we add a callback to the coffee joke here?",
  "type": "message"
}
```

**Special Commands (Optional):**
Certain special messages (commands) could be interpreted (e.g. `/idea` to create a brainstorm card, see Stage 13), but generally it's free-form text passed along.

### UI Display

A **chat sidebar** is shown alongside the script editor during collaboration.

**Features:**
- Displays messages in chronological order
- Labeled with the sender's name (or avatar) and time
- Speech-bubble or threaded styling to distinguish different users' messages
- Support for simple markdown or emoji (e.g. 👍 reactions to pitches)
- Text input box at the bottom for typing new messages

**Mode Switching:**
- If the chat can switch to different modes (as Stage 13 describes a brainstorm board mode), there would be UI controls (tabs or toggle) to switch between Chat and Brainstorm Board view

**Design Requirements:**
- When in chat mode, all new messages appear in real-time without needing refresh
- Chat panel is unobtrusive yet easily accessible
- Complementing the script editor (for instance, resizing or hide/show the chat)

### QA / Validation Steps

1. **Multi-User Messaging:** Have two or more collaborators send messages and confirm all parties see them with correct user attribution.

2. **Message Ordering:** Messages should appear in the same order they were sent (even if two are sent nearly simultaneously, check the timestamp ordering or an ID to sort).

3. **Rapid Message Flow:** Validate that the chat can handle rapid message flow (typing a quick series of messages doesn't lag or drop any).

4. **History Loading:** New participants joining mid-session should load the past messages. Test that scenario to ensure the history fetch works and that it doesn't duplicate messages already shown.

5. **Content Handling:**
   - Send a long message to see that text wrapping and scrolling work in the UI
   - Send potentially problematic content (e.g. HTML or scripts) to ensure it's escaped or sanitized for security

6. **Privacy and Retention:** Consider that when a collaboration session ends, the chat log is saved or cleared appropriately.

### Dev Notes (Optional)

- The chat might be extended with **slash-commands** or integrated bot suggestions (for example, an AI persona might post a tip in chat occasionally)
- If so, test those automations (e.g. `/askAI` generating a message from the AI assistant)
- From a dev perspective, the chat uses WebSocket events (or could use a service like Socket.io)
- Monitoring the socket connection is key – perhaps implement a **heartbeat or ping** to ensure the connection stays alive
- In DevTools, one can inspect the WebSocket frames to confirm message payloads
- If using the same socket for editing and chat, ensure message types are clearly distinguished to route them correctly on the client

## Stage 13: Brainstorm Board

### Summary

Offers an interactive **"whiteboard"** for idea brainstorming, where collaborators (and the AI, optionally) can post sticky-note style ideas, jokes, or references that aren't part of the script yet. This is essentially a visual mode in the chat sidebar that collects creative ideas: users can throw out wild concepts or alternate jokes on virtual index cards. It helps teams organize and save potential material without immediately editing the script, mimicking a writers' room pinboard.

### Trigger / Function

Toggled by users from the chat interface (e.g. clicking a "Brainstorm Board" tab or button in the collaboration sidebar). When activated, the system switches the collaboration sidebar into board mode.

**Implementation:**
- The same backend supporting the chat likely handles board items, or a dedicated service (e.g. `BoardManager`)
- Functions include:
  - `addBrainstormItem(sessionId, user, content, type)` to post a new idea
  - `moveBrainstormItem(itemId, newOrder/position)` if reordering or categorizing is allowed
- These board events, like chat, are broadcast to all users so the board stays in sync
- Board items are stored similarly to chat messages (in-memory plus DB save), but as separate entities with possible attributes (like an ID, text, maybe a category or an image URL if images are allowed)

### Data Contract

**Input:** New idea posts containing:
- Content (text or maybe link/image)
- Optional metadata (e.g. a tag like "character idea" or an association to a script line if dragged from script)
- Move or delete events if the board allows rearranging or removing ideas

**Output:** The current set of brainstorm notes in the session. Could be represented as an array of objects each with:
- `id`
- `author`
- `content`
- `timestamp`
- `(x,y)` position or order
- `type`

If the board is purely list-based (e.g. just a column of sticky notes), position might not be needed. If it's more free-form (drag anywhere), coordinates or a grid placement is output.

The data is not part of the main script analysis but is part of session state. The board persists through the session (and possibly can be saved for later reference).

**Brainstorm Item Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "idea_789",
  "sessionId": "session_456",
  "author": "Bob",
  "content": "What if the dog talks in the third act?",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T14:35:00Z",
  "type": "character_idea",
  "position": {"x": 100, "y": 200},
  "tags": ["character", "twist"]
}
```

### UI Display

In the collaboration sidebar, when switched to **Brainstorm Board mode**, the UI might show a grid or canvas where each idea is a card (a colored sticky note element).

**Features:**
- Add a new idea by typing in an input (similar to chat but it creates a note), or by clicking a "+" button
- Each idea card displays the content and possibly the author's name or initials
- Users (or only the author) might drag cards around to cluster related ideas
  - Example: grouping joke ideas by scene or by character
- Converting a brainstorm idea into script text: e.g. dragging a note onto the script editor to insert that idea at a particular point

**Design Requirements:**
- Focus on visualization and ease of reordering ideas
- Should feel playful and creative (like a corkboard or mind-map)
- "Back to Chat" toggle to return to normal chat mode

### QA / Validation Steps

1. **Collaborative Sync:** Ensure that when one user posts an idea, it appears on all screens in the same position/order.

2. **Reordering:** If the board allows reordering or dragging, test that moving a note on one client updates it for others (and that no ghost duplicates or desync occur).

3. **Content Variety:**
   - Test text length limits (a very long idea might need truncation or a bigger card)
   - Test image support if any (an image could be displayed as a thumbnail on a card)

4. **Mode Switching:** Test the transition between chat and board views. Nothing should be lost or duplicated when switching modes.

5. **Script Integration:** If dragging a note into the script is supported, try it and confirm:
   - The note's text inserts into the script editor for all users
   - Possibly marks the note as resolved or used

6. **Persistence:** Ensure that brainstorming ideas persist for the session – if everyone leaves and comes back (or refreshes), the ideas should still be there (assuming we save them on the server).

7. **Performance:** Monitor that the board's data structure doesn't bloat with too many items or cause performance issues with lots of moves.

### Dev Notes (Optional)

- The brainstorm board might later integrate **AI assistance** – e.g. an "Inspire Me" button that asks the AI to post a random joke idea to the board
- If such features exist, validate their integration (AI ideas should be clearly marked and reasonably relevant)
- Dev-wise, if a library or framework is used for a drag-and-drop board (like a React DnD or similar), ensure it works well with concurrent updates from other users (which can be tricky)
- It might be prudent to lock position editing to one user at a time or simply use a sorted list model to avoid coordinate conflicts
- Logging board events (like creation, movement) to the console can help debug synchronization

## Stage 14: Collaborative Commenting

### Summary

Allows collaborators to leave **comments anchored to specific parts of the script**, facilitating asynchronous feedback and discussion on particular lines or sections. This is akin to Google Docs comments – a user can highlight a joke or a scene and add a remark (e.g. "Could we make this punchline stronger?"), and others can reply in a thread. Collaborative commenting provides a focused way to discuss improvements without altering the text, preserving notes for later resolution. It's an essential tool for teams to review the script together and keep track of issues or ideas line-by-line.

### Trigger / Function

Available in any multi-user session (and possibly even for single-user as personal notes). Triggered by a UI action: e.g. selecting text and clicking "Add Comment" or clicking in the margin next to a line.

**Implementation:**
- Backend handles comments likely via a REST API or WebSocket as well
- Example: a call `POST /script/:id/comment` with the content, line reference, and user
- Server assigns an ID and broadcasts the new comment to collaborators (or in a pull model, clients regularly fetch comments)
- Each comment thread stored in a database with fields:
  - Script ID
  - Anchor (could be line number or range)
  - Author
  - Text
  - Timestamp
  - Thread ID for replies
- Function `addCommentReply(threadId, user, text)` handles replies

### Data Contract

**Input:** Comment creation events including:
- Location (anchor reference to script content)
- Comment text

**Output:** Updated list of comments for the script. The data model likely groups comments by anchor.

**Example Structure:**
```json
{
  "comments": [
    {
      "anchor": "Line 45-46",
      "threadId": "thread_101",
      "comments": [
        {
          "id": 101,
          "user": "Alice",
          "text": "Funny line!",
          "timestamp": "2025-10-23T14:40:00Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 102,
          "user": "Bob",
          "text": "Maybe add a callback here",
          "timestamp": "2025-10-23T14:42:00Z"
        }
      ],
      "resolved": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Anchoring Strategy:**
Anchors could also be tagged by an internal marker inserted in the text (like an invisible ID) to remain consistent even if the text shifts slightly.

The comment threads are persisted so they remain across sessions until resolved or deleted. This stage doesn't feed into analysis scores, but it intersects with the workflow as a collaboration artifact.

### UI Display

In the script editor UI, comments are typically indicated by an **icon or highlight**.

**Features:**
- A line with a comment might have a small speech-bubble icon on the margin
- Clicking it (or hovering) opens the comment thread in a sidebar or overlay
- Comment thread UI shows the conversation: original comment and any replies, each labeled with author and time
- Users can enter a reply in a text box right there
- Resolved comments might be hidden or greyed out

**Design Requirements:**
- Highlighting the relevant text when a comment is selected
- Different color highlight if multiple comment threads overlap
- Summary view might list all comments in the script (maybe in a panel accessible via a "Comments" button) to help navigate feedback

The overall look and feel should integrate with the dark theme and professional style of Laugh Lab Pro, using accent colors to mark comments (without distracting too much from the script).

### QA / Validation Steps

1. **Comment Visibility:** On a collaborative session, have one user add a comment to a line and verify all others see the comment icon appear at the correct location.

2. **Reply Functionality:** Test replying: all participants should see new replies in real-time.

3. **Text Shifting:** Move or edit the script text around a commented section to ensure the comment either moves correctly with the text or the anchor is still intelligible (depends on implementation; some may anchor by original line numbers which could shift – a robust approach might anchor to a specific segment of text).

4. **Resolution:** Resolve a comment (if that feature exists) and ensure it's no longer prominently visible (but perhaps accessible in a "Resolved" list).

5. **Permissions:** Check permission logic: maybe only the comment author or an admin can delete a comment – try different users to enforce that rule.

6. **Scalability:** Simulate many comments to see that the UI remains navigable (e.g. 50 comments shouldn't all overlap confusingly).

7. **Persistence:** Verify that comments persist if the page is reloaded or a new session starts – they should be stored and retrieved properly.

8. **Security:** Ensure that a user from another project can't fetch or post comments to a script they don't have access to (test using direct API calls with invalid credentials).

### Dev Notes (Optional)

- If **email notifications or alerts** for comments are part of the system (e.g. "Alice mentioned you in a comment"), those should be tested (maybe out of scope for just the web app spec, but worth noting)
- For developers, the commenting system might reuse an existing library or component; ensure it's customized to integrate with our editor
- **Endpoints** likely include:
  - `GET /script/:id/comments`
  - `POST /script/:id/comment` for new comments
- In DevTools, one can inspect network calls to confirm comment payloads and responses
- Test that comment data doesn't leak into the analysis (it shouldn't affect stage 1-10 metrics if properly isolated)

This stage closes the loop on collaboration by providing a clear channel for feedback on specifics without altering the script text directly, making the collaborative process more structured and traceable.

## Implementation Notes for Lovable

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons
- Radix UI for component primitives

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- WebSocket support (Socket.io or native WebSockets)
- REST API for non-real-time operations

**Data Storage:**
- JSON-based analysis results
- Database for persistence (comments, chat history, brainstorm items)

### Key Integration Points

1. **Analysis Pipeline:** Stages 6-10 extend the existing analysis flow and should integrate seamlessly with the orchestration pipeline from Stages 1-5.

2. **Collaboration Features:** Stages 11-14 are independent features that can be developed in parallel but should share WebSocket infrastructure where possible.

3. **Progressive Disclosure:** All stages should follow the established pattern of revealing information step-by-step to prevent user overwhelm.

4. **Dark Theme Consistency:** Maintain the established dark theme with blue gradients, rounded corners, and yellow/gold accent colors.

### Development Priorities

**Phase 1 - Analysis Extensions (Stages 6-10):**
- These build directly on existing analysis infrastructure
- Can be developed sequentially
- Each stage adds a new panel to the results dashboard

**Phase 2 - Collaboration Foundation (Stage 11):**
- Real-time editing is the foundation for all collaboration features
- Must be solid before building Stages 12-14

**Phase 3 - Collaboration Features (Stages 12-14):**
- Can be developed in parallel once Stage 11 is complete
- Share WebSocket infrastructure
- Each adds a new mode or feature to the collaboration sidebar

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:** For analysis algorithms and data transformations
2. **Integration Tests:** For API endpoints and WebSocket events
3. **Multi-Client Tests:** For all collaboration features
4. **Performance Tests:** For large scripts and many concurrent users
5. **Security Tests:** For access control and data isolation
